piw-remove
==========

The piw-remove script is used to manually remove a version of a package from
the system. All builds for the specified version will be forgotten, and all
files generated by such builds will be deleted.

By default, the version removed will be deleted entirely (*not* marked to
skip). Optionally, you can provide a skip reason; in this case the version will
not be deleted (though its builds and files will), but will be left marked to
skip to prevent future rebuilds.

Usage
=====

This utility is typically used in response to a request from a package
maintainer to remove a specific build from the system. Usually because the
presence of a piwheels build is causing issues in and of itself.

.. note::

    Older versions of piwheels didn't heed PyPI deletion messages. This is no
    longer the case and this utility is no longer required to manually remove
    deleted packages.

The utility can be run in a batch mode with :option:`--yes` but still requires
invoking once per deletion required (you cannot remove multiple versions in a
single invocation).

The return code will be 0 if the version was successfully removed. If anything
fails, the return code will be non-zero and no files should be deleted (but
this cannot be guaranteed in all circumstances).

The utility should only ever be run directly on the master node (opening the
import queue to other machines is a potential security risk).
