The piw-initdb script is used to initialize or upgrade the piwheels master
database. The target PostgreSQL database must already exist, and the DSN should
connect as a cluster superuser (e.g. the postgres user), in contrast to the
piw-master script which should *not* use the cluster superuser. The script will
prompt before making any permanent alterations, and all actions will be
executed within a single transaction so that in the event of failure the
database will be left unchanged. Nonetheless, it is strongly recommended you
take a backup of your database before using this script for upgrades.
