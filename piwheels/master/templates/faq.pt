      <h5>How do I install packages from piwheels?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>You should have a file at <code>/etc/pip.conf</code> containing:</p>

        <pre>[global]
extra-index-url=https://www.piwheels.org/simple</pre>

        <p>If that's there, pip should use piwheels. If not, create the file
        and add those lines to it.</p>

        <p>Note that pip version 9 or above is required.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>How do I install a package from piwheels without changing my pip
        configuration?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>You can use piwheels as an additional index, which will allow pip
        to fall back to PyPI if the requested package (or one of its
        dependencies) is not available on piwheels, by using the
        <code>--extra-index-url</code> option, for example:</p>

        <pre>pip3 install numpy --extra-index-url https://www.piwheels.org/simple</pre>

        <p>Alternatively, to only use piwheels, use the <code>-i</code> or
        <code>--index-url</code> option, for example:</p>

        <pre>pip3 install numpy -i https://www.piwheels.org/simple</pre>

        <p>or</p>

        <pre>pip3 install numpy --index-url https://www.piwheels.org/simple</pre>
      </div>

      <h5>How do I install a package from PyPI (not from piwheels)?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>If your pip is configured to use piwheels, but you want to use
        PyPI instead, you can either remove or comment out the
        <code>extra-index-url</code> configuration in
        <code>/etc/pip.conf</code>, or you can explicitly request no binary
        distribution in the installation command, and you'll get source
        distribution from PyPI, for example:</p>

        <pre>pip3 install numpy --no-binary :all:</pre>

        <p>or to use the <code>--no-binary</code> option for a single package
        (e.g. get the tensorflow wheel but force a build of one of its
        dependencies, grpcio):</p>

        <pre>pip3 install tensorflow --no-binary grpcio</pre>
      </div>

      <h5 id="sudo">Should I use sudo? Should I use pip or pip3?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>Since the release of Debian Bookworm, installations with <code>sudo</code> are no longer
        permitted. Instead, it is recommended to use a virtual environment.</p>

        <p>Once a virtual environment is activated, either <code>pip</code> or <code>pip3</code>
        can be used, as they both refer to the virtual environment's Python.</p>

        <p>See the section on <a href="#venv">virtual environments</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <h5 id="venv">How do I install into a virtual environment?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>To create a virtual environment:</p>
        <pre>$ sudo apt install virtualenv python3-virtualenv -y
$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 testpip</pre>
        <p>Enable it:</p>
        <pre>$ source testpip/bin/activate</pre>
        <p>Now you can use <code>pip</code> or <code>pip3</code> to install packages into your environment:</p>
        <pre>(testpip) $ pip3 install numpy</pre>
      </div>

      <h5>piwheels doesn't have the latest version of a package I need. How do
        I install the newest version available from piwheels?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>You can either specify the version you want:</p>
        <pre>pip3 install numpy==1.18.0</pre>
        <p>Or you can use the <code>--prefer-binary</code> flag:</p>
        <pre>pip3 install numpy --prefer-binary</pre>
        <p>This will install the latest version that's available as a
        wheel.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>How much time does piwheels save?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>Time saved depends on the package requested, and the Raspberry
        Pi model used. Some packages usually require significant build
        time, which is avoided by using piwheels. Many packages are
        usually quite quick to install anyway, and only a small amount of
        time is saved. Build time on Pi 1 and Pi Zero is much longer than
        Pi 3 (roughly 6x), so the biggest gains are there.</p>
        <p>piwheels saved Raspberry Pi users over 128 years in
        <a href="https://blog.piwheels.org/piwheels-stats-for-2019/">2019</a>
        and 269 years in
        <a href="https://blog.piwheels.org/piwheels-stats-for-2020">2020</a>.
        See more details in the
        <a href="https://blog.piwheels.org/tag/stats/">stats blog posts</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>I maintain a package on PyPI. How do I publish it on piwheels?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>You don't need to do anything. All package releases on PyPI are
        automatically processed by the piwheels project. As long as you
        upload a source distribution, we'll attempt to build it.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>Why is a package I maintain not available on piwheels?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>Some packages fail to build, for various reasons. If you would like
        to investigate, try building the package yourself on a Raspberry Pi 3
        or 4 with a Lite image by running <code>pip3 wheel package==version
        --no-deps --no-binary package</code>.</p>
        <p>Please see the questions on 
      </div>

      <h5>Why are some versions of a package available on piwheels and other
        versions are not?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>You may discover that piwheels manages to build some versions of a package and fails to
        build others. Success and failure per ABI is noted on each package's project page. Search
        for a package on the <a href="packages.html">package list page</a>. If you maintain the
        package or otherwise have a solution for the build, please let us know and we'll try to 
        resolve it. See the questions on reporting <a href="#issues">package issues</a> and
        <a href="#missing">missing packages</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>How long does it take for a new release to become available on
        piwheels?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>piwheels should notice the registration of a new package or
        version within about 10 seconds. How long it takes for that version
        to be built then depends on two factors:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><em>Build queue</em>. Sometimes, particularly when a new Debian
            version is released, piwheels will be busy working through a
            large build queue, and it may take a while to reach a
            package.</li>
          <li><em>Build time</em>. If the package is pure python it should
            build within a few seconds and appear very quickly. Alternatively
            if it's a big chunk of C++ with lots of generics it can take
            hours to compile (the longest compile time for a successful build
            is currently over 3 hours).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So ultimately the time for a new release to appear can be anything
        from about 10 seconds up to several hours (for complex to build
        packages) or several days (when piwheels has a large backlog of
        packages to work through).</p>
      </div>

      <h5>Does piwheels use cross-compilation?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>No. All wheels are built natively on the Raspberry Pi OS on
        Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 hardware.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>Which Raspberry Pi models are supported by packages provided by
        piwheels?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>All current Raspberry Pi models (as of October 2023) are supported:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Raspberry Pi 5</li>
          <li>Raspberry Pi 400</li>
          <li>Raspberry Pi 4</li>
          <li>Raspberry Pi 3</li>
          <li>Raspberry Pi 2</li>
          <li>Raspberry Pi 1</li>
          <li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
          <li>Raspberry Pi Zero 2</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please also observe answers to questions relating to operating
        systems and Python versions.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>I installed a package from piwheels and it doesn't work as
        expected</h5>
      <div>
        <p>Some packages build differently depending on the tools available.
        For example, if the package <code>matplotlib</code> is built with
        <code>pyqt</code> installed, the wheel will depend on the user also
        having <code>pyqt</code> installed. If it is built without
        <code>pyqt</code>, the user can use <code>matplotlib</code> without
        <code>pyqt</code>.</p>

        <p>If you find an issue with a package installed from piwheels, please let us know and we'll
        try to resolve it. See the questions on reporting <a href="#issues">package issues</a> and
        <a href="#missing">missing packages</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>Which Python versions does piwheels support?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>piwheels supports Python 3 only. While most packages available will work in any version
        of Python 3, some packages are only compatible with the minor version with which they were
        built. We build using for the ABI of the Python 3 version distributed with Debian releases.
        We stop building on each Debian version as it goes end-of-life:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Jessie - Python 3.4 (end-of-life)</li>
          <li>Stretch - Python 3.5 (end-of-life)</li>
          <li>Buster - Python 3.7 (end-of-life)</li>
          <li>Bullseye - Python 3.9</li>
          <li>Bookworm - Python 3.11</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h5>Where can I find the piwheels source code?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>The source code for the piwheels project can be found on GitHub at
        <a href="https://github.com/piwheels/piwheels">github.com/piwheels/piwheels</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>What infrastructure does the piwheels project use?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>The piwheels project is hosted on a cluster of Raspberry Pi 3 and 4s
        provided by <a
        href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/order/rpi">Mythic Beasts</a>.
        The web pages and wheel files are served from a single Raspberry Pi 4,
        we use a separate VM to host the postgreSQL database, and use several other
        Raspberry Pis across different OS versions to build wheels.</p>

        <p>The original build run was completed by a total of 20 Raspberry
        Pis, and now a smaller cluster remains active, continuing to build
        new package releases.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>The package I installed took a long time to install, despite being
        available on piwheels.</h5>
      <div>
        <p>First of all: check your pip configuration and confirm that
        piwheels is in fact being used. You should see <code>Looking in
        indexes: https://pypi.org/simple,
        https://www.piwheels.org/simple</code>.</p>

        <p>If you are definitely using piwheels, it could be that while the
        package you installed was available on piwheels, perhaps one of its
        dependencies is not available, and requires downloading from PyPI and
        building from source. Reading the output from the pip command should
        tell you what's going on, particularly when the <code>-v</code> flag
        is used.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>Why are the wheel files are tagged with Armv6 and Armv7?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>While the hardware in Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero is Armv6, Pi 2 is
        Armv7, Pi 3, 4, 400 and Zero 2 are Armv8, the (32-bit) operating system
        images provided on raspberrypi.com are made to support all three
        architectures (and are compatible with all Raspberry Pi products to
        date) by operating in Armv6 userland.</p>

        <p>However, wheels built on a Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 running the 32-bit
        OS are tagged <code>armv7l</code>. Since wheels built on a Raspberry
        Pi 3/4 will work on a Pi 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Zero or Zero 2, we simply provide Pi
        3/4-built wheels renamed <code>armv6l</code>, with a few exceptions
        (some packages, like opencv and tensorflow, are built with
        optimisations available on Pi 3/4).</p>

        <p>Also see the following question.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>What about 64-bit / aarch64?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>The repository at piwheels.org does not currently support the 64-bit version of the
        Raspberry Pi OS. We have plans to support it in future, but this requires a significant
        amount of work, and then rebuilding all wheels on the new architecture. Read more on the
        <a href="https://blog.piwheels.org/raspberry-pi-os-64-bit-aarch64/">blog</a> and 
        <a href="https://github.com/piwheels/piwheels/issues/220">issue #220</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>What about Ubuntu and other distros?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>The repository at piwheels.org does not support Ubuntu or other
        distributions. It's possible some wheels will work on other
        distributions, but we can't promise that they will. Wheels are built
        against certain shared libraries which we know are available to
        Raspberry Pi OS users too.</p>

        <p>It would be possible for someone to run their own instance of
        piwheels to build wheels on and for another distribution, like
        Ubuntu. To those interested in doing this, please see the <a
        href="https://piwheels.readthedocs.io/">docs</a>, and feel free to
        get in touch.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>Will wheels provided on piwheels work on other Arm platforms?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>Some wheels may work on other Arm platforms, but we can't
        guarantee this. We only officially support Raspberry Pi OS
        on Raspberry Pi, but you may have success using wheels on other
        Debian-based distributions or other boards. We won't accept bug
        reports for unsupported platforms.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>Does piwheels work for the Raspberry Pi Desktop OS for x86?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>See the following question.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>Can I install packages from piwheels on my PC/Mac to speed up
        installations?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>Pure Python wheels will likely work, but there's a much smaller
        speed increase installing from wheels over source distribution.
        Packages requiring compilation are built for a specific architecture,
        so they will not be useful on non-Arm platforms and will be ignored.
        Assuming your pip configuration is set to fall back to PyPI,
        installation will continue from there, which may involve building
        from source. There's no harm in trying to use piwheels on a PC/Mac
        but it's not likely to be very useful.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>Are you going to upload all the wheels to PyPI?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>No &mdash; we can't. Only package maintainers can upload files to
        PyPI. We don't recommend that package maintainers upload Raspberry Pi
        Arm wheels to PyPI in case they don't work on other Arm platforms.
        Raspberry Pi users have access to piwheels, so that should
        suffice.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>I'm a package maintainer. Can I upload an Arm wheel to PyPI?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>PyPI now allows uploading Armv6 and Armv7 wheels, but we recommend
        that you don't upload Arm wheels to PyPI for incompatibility reasons
        and other complications.</p>

        <p>Wheels built on a Raspberry Pi 3, although tagged
        <code>armv7l</code> are not truly Armv7, and may be incompatible with
        other Arm platforms. If your package is made exclusively for the
        Raspberry Pi platform, there is no harm in uploading Arm wheels to
        PyPI, and this will speed up the installation for users who do not
        have pip configured to use piwheels. However, it is not possible to
        upload two identical wheel files with <code>armv6l</code> and
        <code>armv7l</code> platform tags, so the second one will be rejected
        by PyPI.</p>

        <p>If you intend for your package to be installed by users in
        multiple Arm platforms, you may be best not to upload Arm wheels to
        PyPI and instead leave Raspberry Pi users to get a wheel from
        piwheels, and leave other Arm platform users to build from
        source.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>I'm a package maintainer. How can I request rebuild or removal of a wheel from piwheels?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>Please contact us by <a href="ben@piwheels.org">email</a> or open an issue on our package
        issue tracker on GitHub (see the question on <a href="#issues">package issues</a>) and we'll
        endeavour to remove it as soon as we can. In cases where it's not obvious that the requester
        owns the package to be removed, we may require further evidence that you are authorized to
        request its removal (e.g. posting as the GitHub owner of the project, or some similar
        standard of proof on the relevant hosting service).</p>

        <p>If you do request removal, please let us know if you'd like piwheels to avoid building
        future releases of your package. We can arrange this trivially with a skip flag in our
        database.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>My package is really popular, so why are the download stats so low?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>We only log downloads from piwheels.org, not from PyPI. If your package is pure Python,
        and you submit wheels to PyPI, users may get the file from PyPI, not from piwheels. You can
        use projects like <a href="https://pypistats.org">pypistats.org</a> to get the numbers from
        PyPI, and aggregate them.</p>

        <p>Additionally, if your project is packaged for Debian, people could be installing your
        package with apt, rather than pip.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>I installed a package from piwheels and I get an ImportError with the message "cannot open
      shared object file".</h5>
      <div>
        <p>Packages built by piwheels may depend on the presence of certain
        shared libraries. This is resolved by installing apt packages which
        provide the required shared objects.</p>

        <p>We calculate dependencies after building wheels, and show them on
        the package project pages.</p>

        <p>It is possible to discover dependencies yourself using
        <code>ldd</code> and <code>apt-file</code>. Read more about this
        process on the <a href="https://blog.piwheels.org/how-to-work-out-the-missing-dependencies-for-a-python-package/">piwheels
        blog</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>How can I download all the wheels I need for an offline installation?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>Sometimes you need to download wheels ahead of time, for
        installation later, or download the wheels you need using your PC,
        and then transfer them to a Raspberry Pi which is offline.</p>
        <p>To download the wheels on a Raspberry Pi, for use on the same Pi
        model, it could be as simple as:</p>

        <pre>mkdir wheels
cd wheels
pip3 wheel <em>&lt;package&gt;</em></pre>

        <p>To download the wheels using your PC, you will need to provide
        additional flags to specify the spec of the Pi. For example, Armv7
        wheels (for a Pi 2/3/4) for Bookworm (cp11):</p>

        <pre>mkdir wheels
cd wheels
python3 -m pip download \
    --extra-index-url https://www.piwheels.org/simple \
    --implementation cp \
    --platform linux_armv7l \
    --abi cp39 \
    --only-binary=:all: \
    <em>&lt;package&gt;</em></pre>

        <p>You'll need to alter the flags according to platform and ABI
        requirements.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>How can I force installation of Armv6 wheels?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>Sometimes you need to install the Armv6 wheels, even if you're on
        a Pi 2/3/4/400/Zero 2, because you intend to use the SD card on multiple models,
        including Pi 1/Zero.</p>
        <p>Note that in almost all cases, the Armv6 and Armv7 wheels are
        identical, and compatible on both architectures. The only exceptions
        are opencv and tensorflow.</p>
        <p>To ensure the Armv6 wheels are installed on a Pi 2/3/4, you need
        to find the location of the Armv6 wheels, download them and rename
        them.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to the package's <a href="packages.html">project page</a>,
            scroll down to the Files section, and find the file you need.</li>
          <li>Copy the full URL of the file location, e.g.
            https://www.piwheels.org/simple/tensorflow/tensorflow-1.14.0-cp37-none-linux_armv6l.whl</li>
          <li>Download the file</li>
          <li>Rename the file, changing <code>armv6l</code> to
            <code>armv7l</code></li>
          <li>Use pip to install the file</li>

      <h5>How do I find out why a package failed to build?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>Navigate to the <a href="packages.html">project page</a> for the package, and you should
        see which versions are available for each Python version. If a build failed, it will show a
        red cross. If you click the build status icon, you'll see the build log that shows the output
        from the build. This may indicate where the build failed, and why. See the following questions
        on reporting issues to us.</p>

      <h5 id="issues">How do I report a problem with a package built by piwheels?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>Issues with packages are tracked within the <a href="https://github.com/piwheels/packages">piwheels/packages</a>
        GitHub repository.</p>
        <p>Navigate to the <a href="packages.html">project page</a> for the package, and you should
        see which versions are available for each Python version. If your attempt to install a
        package failed, check if this is because we don't have a successful build for the package,
        or the version your require. Note that installing one package may result in failure to install
        another dependent package. If a build failed, it will show a
        red cross. If your issue is that the package, or a version of a package, is not available on
        piwheels, please see the following question on missing packages. If you determine there is
        an issue with the way a package was built by piwheels, please open an issue against the
        package in question.</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the project page, you'll see "Search issues for this package". Clicking
        this will search GitHub for issues reported about this package. If there are already issues
        for the package, links to those issues will be shown. If not, you can click one of the links
        below this to report one. Please open a new issue, and we'll follow up as we investigate.</p>

      <h5>I got a hash mismatch when trying to install a package from piwheels</h5>
      <div>
        <p>We've seen some (very few) reports of hash mismatches when people
        are using piwheels.</p>
        <p>First of all, don't ignore the hash mismatch &mdash; it's
        important to verify that the file you downloaded is the file you were
        expecting.</p>
        <p>You need to download the file, verify it, and install it
        manually:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to the package's <a href="packages.html">project page</a>,
            find the version you need, and open up the list of files. Choose
            the right file for your Python version and architecture.</li>
          <li>Copy the full URL of the file location (without the checksum
            which follows the hash), e.g.
            https://www.piwheels.org/simple/tensorflow/tensorflow-1.14.0-cp37-none-linux_armv7l.whl</li>
          <li>Download the file:
            <pre>wget https://www.piwheels.org/simple/tensorflow/tensorflow-1.14.0-cp37-none-linux_armv7l.whl</pre></li>
          <li>Check the sha256sum of the file:
            <pre>sha256sum tensorflow-1.14.0-cp37-none-linux_armv7l.whl</pre></li>
          <li>Verify that it matches the checksum after the hash in the URL
            on the project page:</li>
          <li>If it matches:
            <ul>
              <li>That means pip was timing out trying to download the file,
                and you ended up with a corrupted file. This is a bug in pip
                which is difficult to reproduce.</li>
              <li>It's safe to install the wheel, so you can use
                <code>pip</code> to install directly from the file: <code>pip3 install
                tensorflow-1.14.0-cp37-none-linux_armv7l.whl</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If it doesn't match:
            <ul>
              <li>Rename the file extension from <code>.whl</code> to
                <code>.zip</code> and try to open it as a zip file. If it
                opens correctly, it should look like a Python package. If it
                does, that means the hash mismatch is genuine, so please <a
                href="https://github.com/piwheels/packages/issues/new/choose">open
                an issue</a> and understand the risk before proceeding to
                install it.</li>
              <li>If not, it's probably corrupted (which expains your original
                problem). Try downloading it again, and check your internet
                connection is stable.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h5>I need to remove a release</h5>
      <div>
        <p>If you delete a package or version from PyPI, it will also be
        deleted from piwheels, and any files relating to the package or
        version will be removed. In the case of version removal, the project
        page will be updated to remove the version in question. In the case
        of package deletion, the project page will be deleted.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, package maintainers have the ability to "yank"
        releases from PyPI. Yanking a release allows authors to effectively
        delete a version's files, without breaking things for people who have
        pinned to exactly a specific version. Releases yanked from PyPI will
        be reflected in piwheels, both in the simple index and visually on
        the project page. Read more about "yank" in <a
          href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0592/">PEP-592</a>.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Yes! Read about the <a href="json.html">piwheels JSON API</a>.</p>
