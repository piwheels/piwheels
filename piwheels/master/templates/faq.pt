extra-index-url=https://www.piwheels.org/simple</pre>

              <p>If that's there, pip should use piwheels. If not, create the

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>You can use piwheels as an additional index,
              which will allow pip to fall back to PyPI if the requested
              package (or one of its dependencies) is not available on
              piwheels, by using the <code>--extra-index-url</code> option, for
              example:</p>

              <pre>sudo pip3 install numpy --extra-index-url https://www.piwheels.org/simple</pre>

              <p>Alternatively, to only use piwheels, use the <code>-i</code> or
              <code>--index-url</code> option, for example:</p>

              <pre>sudo pip3 install numpy -i https://www.piwheels.org/simple</pre>

              <p>or</p>

              <pre>sudo pip3 install numpy --index-url https://www.piwheels.org/simple</pre>

              <p>If your pip is configured to use piwheels, but you want to use

              source distribution from PyPI, for example:</p>

              <pre>sudo pip3 install numpy --no-binary :all:</pre>

              <p>or to use the <code>--no-binary</code> option for a single
              package (e.g. get the tensorflow wheel but force a build of one
              of its dependencies, grpcio):</p>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>Time saved depends on the package requested, and the Raspberry
              Pi model used. Some packages usually require significant build
              time, which is avoided by using piwheels. Many packages are
              usually quite quick to install anyway, and only a small amount of
              time is saved. Build time on Pi 1 and Pi Zero is much longer than
              Pi 3 (roughly 6x), so the biggest gains are there.</p>

              <p>Some packages fail to build, for various reasons. If you would

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>You may discover that piwheels manages to build some versions
              of a package and fails to build others. Success and failure per
              ABI is noted on each package's project page. Search for a package
              on the <a href="packages.html">package
              list page</a>. If you maintain the package or otherwise have a
              solution for the build, please <a

            <a href="#" class="accordion-title">How long does it take for a new release
              to become available on piwheels?</a>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>piwheels should notice the registration of a new package or
              version within about 10 seconds. How long it takes for that
              version to be built then depends on two factors:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><em>Build queue</em>. Sometimes, particularly when a new
                Debian version is released, piwheels will be busy working
                through a large build queue, and it may take a while to reach a
                package.</li>
                <li><em>Build time</em>. If the package is pure python it
                  should build within a few seconds and appear very quickly.
                  Alternatively if it's a big chunk of C++ with lots of
                  generics it can take hours to compile (the longest compile
                  time for a successful build is currently over 3 hours).</li>
              </ul>

              <p>So ultimately the time for a new release to appear can be
              anything from about 10 seconds up to several hours (for complex
              to build packages) or several days (when piwheels has a large
              backlog of packages to work through).</p>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>Some packages build differently depending on the tools
              available. For example, if the package <code>matplotlib</code> is
              built with <code>pyqt</code> installed, the wheel will depend on
              the user also having <code>pyqt</code> installed. If it is built
              without <code>pyqt</code>, the user can use
              <code>matplotlib</code> without <code>pyqt</code>.</p>

              <p>piwheels supports Python 3 only. While most

              packages are only compatible with the minor version with which
              they were built. We build using for the ABI of the Python 3
              version distributed with Debian releases:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Jessie - Python 3.4</li>
                <li>Stretch - Python 3.5</li>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>The piwheels project is hosted on a cluster of Raspberry Pi 3s
              provided by <a
              href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/order/rpi">Mythic Beasts</a>.
              The web pages and wheel files are served from a single Raspberry
              Pi, we use a separate VM to host the database, and use several
              other Raspberry Pis accross different OS versions to build
              wheels.</p>

              <p>The original build run was completed by a total of 20
              Raspberry Pis, and now a smaller cluster remains active,
              continuing to build new package releases.</p>

              piwheels is in fact being used. You should see <code>downloading

              <p>If you are definitely using piwheels, it could be that while
              the package you installed was available on piwheels, perhaps one
              of its dependencies is not available, and requires downloading
              from PyPI and building from source. Reading the output from the

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>While the hardware in Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero is Armv6, Pi 2 is
              Armv7, Pi 3 and 4 are Armv8, the (32-bit) operating system images

              architectures (and are compatible with all Raspberry Pi products
              to date) by operating in Armv6 userland.</p>

              <p>However, wheels built on a Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 running the
              32-bit OS are tagged <code>armv7l</code>. Since wheels built on a
              Raspberry Pi 3 will work on a Pi 4, 3, 2, 1 or Zero, we simply
              provide Pi 3-built wheels renamed <code>armv6l</code>, with a few
              exceptions (some packages, like opencv and tensorflow, are built

              It's possible some wheels will work on other distributions, but we can't promise
              that they will. Wheels are built against certain shared libraries which we know
              are available to Raspberry Pi OS / Raspbian users too.</p>

              <p>It would be possible for someone to run their own instance of

              <p>Pure Python wheels will likely work, but there's a much
              smaller speed increase installing from wheels over source
              distribution. Packages requiring compilation are built for a
              specific architecture, so they will not be useful on non-Arm
              platforms and will be ignored. Assuming your pip configuration
              is set to fall back to PyPI, installation will continue from
              there, which may involve building from source. There's no harm in
              trying to use piwheels on a PC/Mac but it's not likely of any
              help.</p>

              <p>No &mdash; we can't. Only package maintainers can upload files to
              PyPI. We don't recommend that package maintainers upload Raspberry
              Pi Arm wheels to PyPI in case they don't work on other Arm
              platforms. Raspberry Pi users have access to piwheels, so that
              should suffice.</p>

            <a href="#" class="accordion-title">I'm a package maintainer. Can I
            upload an Arm wheel to PyPI?</a>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>PyPI now allows uploading Armv6 and Armv7 wheels, but we
              recommend that you don't upload Arm wheels to PyPI for
              incompatibility reasons and other complications.</p>

              <p>Wheels built on a Raspberry Pi 3, although tagged
              <code>armv7l</code> are not truly Armv7, and may be incompatible
              with other Arm platforms. If your package is made exclusively for
              the Raspberry Pi platform, there is no harm in uploading Arm
              wheels to PyPI, and this will speed up the installation for users
              who do not have pip configured to use piwheels. However, it is not
              possible to upload two indentical wheel files with
              <code>armv6l</code> and <code>armv7l</code> platform tags, so the
              second one will be rejected by PyPI.</p>

              <p>If you intend for your package to be installed by users in
              multiple Arm platforms, you may be best not to upload Arm wheels
              to PyPI and instead leave Raspberry Pi users to get a wheel from
              piwheels, and leave other Arm platform users to build from
              source.</p>

              as we can. In cases where it's not obvious that the requester
              owns the package to be removed, we may require further evidence
              that you are authorized to request its removal (e.g. posting as
              the GitHub owner of the project, or some similar standard of
              proof on the relevant hosting service).</p>

              <p>Note that we only currently track package additions from PyPI
              upstream; we <i>don't</i> honour package removals from PyPI hence
              removals must be requested manually. Frankly, package removal
              is an area fraught with difficulty. Even if we remove a given
              package from piwheels there's no guarantee some downstream mirror
              hasn't already got it, or another mirror of PyPI. The best
              solution to ensure your users avoid a given release is to cut a
              <i>new</i> release of your package with a higher version
              number.</p>

              <p>If you do request removal, please let us know if you'd like
              piwheels to avoid building future releases of your package. We
              can arrange this trivially via a skip flag in our database.</p>

              <p>We only log downloads from piwheels.org, not from PyPI. If your

              projects like <a href="https://pypistats.org">pypistats.org</a> to
              get the numbers from PyPI, and aggregate them.</p>

              <p>Additionally, if your project is packaged for Debian, people

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>Packages built by piwheels may depend on the presence of

              <p>It is possible to discover dependencies yourself using

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>Sometimes you need to download wheels ahead of time, for installation later, or download the wheels
                you need using your PC, and then transfer them to a Raspberry Pi which is offline.</p>
              <p>To download the wheels on a Raspberry Pi, for use on the same Pi model, it could be as simple as:</p>

              <pre>mkdir wheels
cd wheels
pip3 wheel &lt;package&gt;</pre>

              <p>To download the wheels using your PC, you will need to provide additional flags to specify the spec of
              the Pi. For example, Armv7 wheels (for a Pi 2/3/4) for Buster (cp37m):</p>

              <pre>mkdir wheels
cd wheels
python3 -m pip download --extra-index-url https://www.piwheels.org/simple --only-binary=:all: --implementation cp --platform linux_armv7l --abi cp37m --only-binary=:all: &lt;package&gt;</pre>

            <p>You'll need to alter the flags according to platform and ABI requirements.</p>

            <a href="#" class="accordion-title">How can I force installation of Armv6 wheels?</a>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>Sometimes you need to install the Armv6 wheels, even if you're on a Pi 2/3/4, because you intend to
              use the SD card on multiple models, including Pi 1/Zero.</p>
              <p>Note that in almost all cases, the Armv6 and Armv7 wheels are identical, and compatible on both
              architectures. The only exceptions are opencv and tensorflow.</p>
              <p>To ensure the Armv6 wheels are installed on a Pi 2/3/4, you need to find the location of the Armv6
              wheels, download them and rename them.</p>

            <a href="#" class="accordion-title">I got a hash mismatch when trying to install a package from piwheels</a>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>We've seen some (very few) reports of hash mismatches when people are using piwheels. This seems to happen
              with the combination of large files and slow internet connections.</p>
              <p>First of all, don't ignore the hash mismatch &mdash; it's important to verify that the file you downloaded
              is the file you were expecting.</p>
              <p>You need to download the file, verify it, and install it manually:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Go to the package's <a href="/packages.html">project page</a>, scroll down to the Files section, and find the file you need.</li>
                <li>Copy the full URL of the file location (without the checksum which follows the hash),
                e.g. https://www.piwheels.org/simple/tensorflow/tensorflow-1.14.0-cp37-none-linux_armv7l.whl</li>
                <li>Download the file:
                  <pre>wget https://www.piwheels.org/simple/tensorflow/tensorflow-1.14.0-cp37-none-linux_armv7l.whl</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Check the sha256sum of the file:
                  <pre>sha256sum tensorflow-1.14.0-cp37-none-linux_armv7l.whl</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Verify that it matches the checksum after the hash in the URL on the project page:</li>
                <li>If it matches:
                  <ul>
                    <li>That means pip was timing out trying to download the file, and you ended up with a corrupted file.
                    This is a bug in pip which is difficult to reproduce.</li>
                    <li>It's safe to install the wheel, so you can use <code>pip</code> to install directly from the file:
                    <code>sudo pip3 install tensorflow-1.14.0-cp37-none-linux_armv7l.whl</code></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If it doesn't match:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Rename the file extension from <code>.whl</code> to <code>.zip</code> and try to open it as a zip file. If it opens correctly,
                    it should look like a Python package.
                    If it does, that means the hash mismatch is genuine, so please <a href="https://github.com/piwheels/packages/issues/new/choose">open an issue</a>
                    and understand the risk before proceeding to install it.</li>
                    <li>If not, it's probably corrupted (which expains your original problem). Try downloading it again, and check your internet connection is stable.</li>
                  </ul>
