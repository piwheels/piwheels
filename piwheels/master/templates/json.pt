      <h2>JSON API</h2>

      <p>piwheels.org provides a JSON API for information about packages we
      host.</p>

      <h3>Package information</h3>

      <p>Package information can be found at
      <strong>piwheels.org/project/&lt;package&gt;/json</strong>, e.g. <a
      href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/numpy/json">piwheels.org/project/numpy/json</a>.
      This data includes information about every released version of the
      package, the status of any build attempts made by piwheels, which ABIs
      and platforms we have built files for, and information about these
      files, including filename, filesize, hash, build duration and any apt
      dependencies.</p>

      <p>The project pages themselves (e.g. <a
      href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/numpy">piwheels.org/project/numpy</a>)
      are made up from a subset of the data in this JSON file, and additional
      data is available to that shown on those pages. It is also useful to be
      able to access the data for a package in a structured way from within a
      program, as well as the human readable method via the project page.</p>

      <p>Schema of the JSON data for a project:</p>

      <pre>{
 'package': &lt;str&gt;,
 'summary': &lt;str&gt;,
 'pypi_url': &lt;str&gt;,
 'piwheels_url': &lt;str&gt;,
 'releases': {
    &lt;str&gt;: {
       'skip_reason': &lt;str&gt;,
       'prerelease': True|False,
       'released': &lt;str YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS&gt;,
       'yanked': True|False,
       'files': {
          &lt;str&gt;: {
             'filesize': &lt;int&gt;,
             'apt_dependencies': [&lt;str&gt;, ...],
             'filehash': &lt;str&gt;,
             'platform': &lt;str&gt;,
             'builder_abi': &lt;str&gt;,
             'file_abi_tag': &lt;str&gt;
          }
       }
    }
 }
}</pre>

      <p>Example usage from a Python script:</p>

      <pre>import requests

url = "https://www.piwheels.org/project/numpy/json"
package = requests.get(url).json()

for version, release in package['releases'].items():
  print(version, release['released'])</pre>

      <pre>import requests

url = "https://www.piwheels.org/project/numpy/json"
package = requests.get(url).json()

for version, info in package['releases'].items():
  if info['files']:
      print('{}: {} files'.format(version, len(info['files'])))
  else:
      print('{}: No files'.format(version))
</pre>

      <p>Note that we intend to maintain the API structure, and to only add
      fields, not remove or change fields. In the unlikely event of
      compatibility changes in future.</p>

      <p>Also note that packages and versions can be deleted, and can be
      recreated, so it's inadvisable to expect such data not to change.
      Similarly, piwheels builds can be deleted and rebuilt.</p>

      <h3>Download stats</h3>

      <p>Basic package download stats (total, and last 30 days) are provided
      separately at <a href="https://www.piwheels.org/packages.json">piwheels.org/packages.json</a>.
      (We strongly recommend not opening this link in a web browser - it's
      <em>very large</em>).</p>

      <p>Example usage from a Python script:</p>

      <pre>import requests

url = "https://www.piwheels.org/packages.json"
packages = requests.get(url).json()
packages = {
  pkg: (d_month, d_all)
  for pkg, d_month, d_all, *_ in packages
}

package = 'numpy'
d_month, d_all = packages[package]

print(package, "has had", d_month, "downloads in the last month")
print(package, "has had", d_all, "downloads in total")</pre>

      <p>Note the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements"><code>*_</code></a>
      assignment is optional here but protects against any additional fields
      being added in future.</p>
